# Mushroom Kingdom Expansion Pack
Introducing the Mushroom Kingdom Expansion Pack! Filled with over 700 cards for endless discoveries and battles!

Which one's will join your merry band, and which will be left behind? Will you struggle to make it across Leshy's game or will you gain a powerful ally?

## Heads Up!

Much akin to the kingdom, this pack contains secrets. Try experimenting with the fledgling and icecube sigils and maybe some Merges. 

Be especially on the lookout for powerups! These cards may be useless on the field (save the occasional block) but are free sigils for your cards! Let's hope your luck's up to snuff!

Just be aware there's also reskins to the pelts, Stoat and Pack Rat. Make sure you don't have any mods that affect those cards, lest the game may break...

For the full experience, I'd reccomend disabling the Vanilla pack in Pack manager

Some cards may seem bad, but It's a sacrifice to be made in a pack as big as over 700 cards... 

Be warned that you'll need to activate the Energy Drone and Mox Drone + Refresh in the configs for certain cards to work. This is only a modpack for Act 1 of Inscryption.
